<!-- rails follows mvc of web applications. mvc creates a seperation between the presentation (front end) and all the back end.
programming logic is behind the scenes and all the logic

models are resources such as (user, post, article, stock)
view make up the front end of the app.(visible layer of the app). this consists of html css and javascript
instead of index.html we will have index.html.erb
controller- this is the brains in the app. we have controllers for things such as users post articles.
